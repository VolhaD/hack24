---
participant_about_21: Journalist focused on Russia for the last 10 years. As such, I saw and confronted the first wave of weaponized information that would eventually bring about the now nascent era of post-truth.
That eventually led me to enroll in Tartu and study philosophy, which is what I'm currently doing.

participant_about_23:  I found interesting working with data, so myself I passed two online courses that are related to data analysis in R. In the university I developed my knowledge as here we obligatory study Scientific Python and R programming that gives me opportunity to study in deeper. 1,5 years I was a part of huge student organization and was leading a brand new project at the moment that was quite successful. I have teamleading, teambuilding and "just come down and work" skills.
